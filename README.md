# Amygdala Atlases Comparison

This repository contains datasets and scripts for comparing the definition of the amygdala across different neuroimaging atlases. The goal is to examine how the amygdala is delineated in various commonly used atlases and provide resources for further analysis.

## Atlases Included
- AAL (Automated Anatomical Labeling) – deterministic, single-region definition
- Harvard-Oxford – probabilistic, single-region definition
- Brainnetome – probabilistic, subregional definitions
- Juelich – cytoarchitectonic, subregional definitions
- CIT168 – probabilistic, high-resolution subregions

## Repository Structure
- atlases/ : NIfTI and LUT files for each atlas
- scripts/ : Python and Shell scripts for processing
- results/ : Figures, tables, and output files
- docs/ : Optional GitHub Pages files
- README.md : This file
- LICENSE : License information (CC-BY 4.0 recommended)

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the analysis using the scripts provided. Outputs such as visualizations and tables will be saved in the results folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Taher-Soleimani/Amygdala-Atlases-Comparison.git
